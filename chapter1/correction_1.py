# problem
print( "A message" ). print( "A message " ). print( "A messagef"  )

# solution

# explanation: I removed those single quotes and replaced them with double quotes for achieving consistency in the statement.

# moved statements to each of their own lines to let compile properly.

print( "A message" ) 
print( "A message" ) 
print( "A messagef")
